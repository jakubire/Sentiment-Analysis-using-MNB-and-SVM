        "In the age of social media, platforms like Twitter serve as a vibrant repository of public opinion and sentiment. This study aims to predict the sentiment of text data, specifically focusing on how air travelers express their experiences on Twitter. The data used in this study was sourced from Kaggle, sampled into training and testing. It can be found at Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/crowdflower/twitter-airline-sentiment . This dataset, contributed by Crowdflower, comprises a comprehensive collection of tweets directed at various US airlines, capturing the sentiments of travelers regarding their flying experiences. For example \"@VirginAmerica So excited for my first cross country flight LAX to MCO I've heard nothing but great things about Virgin America\" is a tweet in this data set and it sentiment label is positive.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Overview of the Dataset**\n",
        "\n",
        "The dataset includes approximately 14,640 tweets, each labeled with one of three sentiments: positive, neutral, or negative. Additionally, the dataset provides valuable metadata such as the airline name, the tweet creation time, and the tweet's geographical location.  This rich dataset allows for a multifaceted analysis of travelers' sentiments and the factors influencing these sentiments, however, my focus is only on the text and what sentiment the text implies.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Objectives of the Study**\n",
        "\n",
        "The primary objective of this study is to develop a machine learning model capable of accurately predicting the sentiment of a given tweet. By achieving this, we can gain insights into the overall perception of different airlines and identify specific aspects of the travel experience that elicit strong emotions, be they positive or negative. The predictive model can be used by airlines to monitor customer satisfaction in real-time, enabling them to address issues promptly and improve their services.\n",

        "The data is inbalance. Negative sentiments are more than three times of positive sentiments and about 4 times of neutral. When you have an imbalanced dataset, where one class significantly outnumbers the others, machine learning models tend to become biased towards the majority class. This can result in poor performance, especially for the minority classes. I will up sample the minority class using SMOTE.\n",
        "\n",
        "**SMOTE**, which stands for Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique, is an algorithm used to balance datasets by increasing the number of samples in the minority class. Instead of simply duplicating existing minority samples, SMOTE generates new, synthetic samples by selecting pairs of similar samples in the minority class and creating new samples along the line that connects them. This approach helps to create a more balanced dataset without overfitting to the few existing minority samples, thus improving the performance of machine learning models by making them less biased towards the majority class. Note SMOTE operates only on numerical data, hence I will apply it after vectorizing the text data.\n",

        "\n",
        "Support Vector Machines (SVM) is a powerful and versatile supervised learning algorithm that is particularly effective for text classification tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "SVM works well in high-dimensional spaces where data points are represented by vectors (e.g., word counts or word embeddings). The core idea of SVM is to find the optimal hyperplane (a decision boundary) that best separates the data points of different classes. In two dimensions, this is a line, but in higher dimensions, it’s a plane or hyperplane.\n",
        "\n",
        "SVM aims to maximize the margin, which is the distance between the hyperplane and the closest data points from each class (called support vectors). A larger margin generally leads to better generalization to new data.\n",
        "\n",
        "SVM can handle non-linear separation by using kernel functions, which transform the data into a higher-dimensional space where a linear separation is possible.\n",
        "\n",
        "It Works well with high-dimensional data and is less affected by overfitting. SVM be used for both linear and non-linear classification problems through the use of different kernel functions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Imagine plotting tweets in a space where positive tweets are on one side and negative tweets on the other. SVM finds the best line (or hyperplane) that separates these two groups with the maximum margin."

        "Analyzing the sentiment of tweets directed at airlines offers valuable insights into customer satisfaction and areas needing improvement. Frequent negative sentiments about delays or customer service can prompt airlines to address these issues more effectively, while positive sentiments can highlight strengths that can be leveraged in marketing campaigns. Insights from the misclassified sentiments reveal that negative sentiments are often misclassified. Many of these misclassified negative texts are complex in meaning. For example, a tweet like \"thanks for the response - flight time has passed - rebooked now\" is accurately labeled as negative sentiment but classified as positive. One possible reason for this misclassification could be that the phrase \"thanks for the response\" carries more positive connotations, overshadowing the overall negative sentiment of the tweet. Most of the misclassified positive sentiments contain more emojis than sentences or words.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the context of these complex texts, simple machine learning models like Naive Bayes Classifiers and SVM might perform better at classifying sentiments. Extensive text cleaning and efficient text-to-numeric representation could help improve these ML models. Deep learning models like LSTM are well-suited to handle complexity in text. The Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB) model is faster in terms of training and has also performed slightly better in prediction than the SVM, which takes longer to train.\n",
        "\n",
        "From an application perspective, real-time sentiment analysis can be integrated into customer service dashboards, enabling airlines to promptly respond to negative feedback and enhance the overall travel experience.\n",

        "**Conclusion**\n",
        "\n",
        "This study underscores the significance of sentiment analysis in understanding customer perceptions and improving service quality in the airline industry. By leveraging the Twitter Airline Sentiment dataset from Kaggle, the goal is to develop robust predictive models that not only classify sentiment with high accuracy but also provide actionable insights for airlines to enhance their services and ultimately improve customer satisfaction. As social media continues to shape public opinion, sentiment analysis will remain a vital tool for businesses to stay attuned to their customers' needs and expectations."
